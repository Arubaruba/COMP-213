Create a Web page for entering new customer information. The fields include
name, e-mail, username, and password. Include a second text box
to confirm the password. Set the TextMode property of the two password
fields to “Password”. Use a table to lay out your controls.
 Validate that all fields contain information. Display appropriate messages
for any empty fields. Include a Submit button.
 When all information is entered and the Submit button is pressed,
compare the two password fields to see if they are equal. If not, clear both
text boxes and display a message to reenter the password information.
When the passwords match, display a message that says “Welcome” and
the name of the customer.
