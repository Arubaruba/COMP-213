Design and code a project to calculate the amount due
for rentals. Movies may be in Blu-Ray (BD) format or
DVD format. BD rent for $5.00 each and DVDs rent
for $4.50. New releases are $1 additional charge.
 On the form include a text box to input the movie
title and radio buttons to indicate whether the movie
is in DVD or BD format. Use one check box to indicate
whether the person is a member; members receive
a 10 percent discount. Another check box
indicates a new release.

 Use buttons for Calculate , Clear for Next Item , Order
Complete , Summary , and Exit . The Calculate button
should display the item amount and add to the subtotal.
The Clear for Next Item clears the check box for new
 releases, the movie title, and the radio buttons; the
member check box cannot be changed until the current
order is complete. Include validation to check for missing
data. If the user clicks on the Calculate button without
first entering the movie title and selecting the movie
format, display a message box.
 For the Order Complete button, first confirm the
operation with the user and clear the controls on the
form for a new customer.
 The Summary button displays the number of customers
and the sum of the rental amounts in a message
box. Make sure to add to the custome
