Create a project that will produce a summary of the amounts due for Pat’s
Auto Repair Shop. Display a splash screen first; then display the Job
 Information form. If you wish, you can add a graphic to the form.
 The Job Information Form Menu :
File Edit Help
 Exit Calculate About
 Clear
Job Information Form : The Job Information form must have text boxes for
the user to enter the job number, customer name, amount charged for
6.2

parts, and the hours of labor. Include labels and text boxes for Parts,
 Labor, Subtotal, Sales Tax, and Total.
 The Calculate menu item finds the charges and displays them in labels.
The tax rate and the hourly labor charge should be set up as named constants
so that they can be easily modified if either changes. Current
charges are $50 per hour for labor and 8 percent (.08) for the sales tax
rate. Sales tax is charged only on parts, not on labor.
 The Clear menu item clears the text boxes and resets the focus in the
first text box. 


6.3

Modify Programming Exercise 6.2 so that summary information is maintained
for the total dollar amount for parts, labor, sales tax, and total for
all customers. 
Add a Summary menu item under the File menu before the Exit item;
include a separator bar between the two menu items. When the user selects
the Summary menu item, display the summary information in a Summary
form. The Summary form should have an OK button that closes the
Summary form and returns the user to the Job Information form


Pick two of the programming exercises on page 290-292 in the book and implement

2) Use appropriate names for all the variables
3) Use appropriate comments throughout the code
4) Be creative in the design of the interface
