Create a project to keep track of concert ticket sales by your club. Ticket
prices are based on the section of the auditorium in which the seats are
located. Your program should calculate the price for each sale, accumulate
the total number of tickets sold in each section, display the ticket
price schedule, and print a summary of all sales.
 The form should contain a list box of the sections for seating.
